# Olympics-Data-Analysis
Analyzed historical Summer Olympics data up to 2016, focusing on medal distribution, participation, and athlete performance. Key insights included identifying the prime medal-winning age range of 17-30 years and a higher probability of winning gold medals for athletes aged 31-40. Conducted country-wise and athlete-wise analysis to highlight top performers and emerging nations. This project demonstrated the value of data-driven analysis in uncovering performance trends and insights in sports.
